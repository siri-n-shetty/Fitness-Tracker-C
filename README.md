# Fitness-Tracker-in-C

**Course: UE22CS252A (Data Structures and its Applications)**

## Problem Statement 

In this *hackathon* challenge, participants are challenged to enhance the efficiency of fitness tracking systems. The goal is to use data structures to improve the overall process of monitoring and analyzing fitness data. Your task is to design and implement data structures that enhance the organization, analysis, and presentation of fitness-related information. The solution should showcase how well-designed data structures and algorithms contribute to a more effective and insightful fitness tracking experience.

**Specific tasks for participants include:**

- Developing data structures to efficiently store and manage diverse fitness data, such as workout logs, nutrition information, and health metrics.
- Designing algorithms for analyzing fitness trends, setting achievable goals, and providing personalized insights.
- Implementing features for visualizing fitness data in an informative and user-friendly manner.
- Ensuring the system can handle a variety of fitness activities, user preferences, and customizable tracking parameters.
- Participants are encouraged to consider the flexibility and adaptability of their solutions to cater to a wide range of fitness tracking needs.
- The final project should demonstrate a strong understanding of data structures while addressing the specific challenges of fitness tracking.
